Calypso is a set of programs for MHD dynamo simulation in a rotating spherical
shell using spherical harmonics expansion methods.

The Calypso distribution consists of the following files and directories.

% ls
CMakeLists.txt  LICENSE         README          configure.in    examples/

INSTALL: Brief installation procedure
LICENSE: License
README:  This file

configure.in:     Input file for autoconf
Makefile.in:      Template for Makefile used by configure
configure:        Configuration script
CMakeLists.txt:   Configuration file for CMake

bin:      Directory for programs (created by make)
doxygen:  Directory for source documentation 
examples: Directory for examples
src:      Directory for source files
work:     Work directory (created by make)

For installation instructions, please read INSTALL or the documentation page 16--19.

The following instructions will setup a build for Calypso with GPU optimizations using CMAKE on Maverick:
	1). module load cuda
	2). mkdir <NAME_of_DIRECTORY> && cd <NAME_OF_DIRECTORY>
	3). cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE <PATH_TO_CALYPSO_SRC_ROOT_DIR>
	4). make -j <number_of_processes>
Note that cmake can be ran with a multitude of options that specify compilers, flags, libraries and etc.
Some of the common ones to be aware of are:
	-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER, -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER, -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH 
For example, the third command can be modified to:
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=<Full_Path_to_ifort> <PATH_TO_CALYPSO_SRC_ROOT_DIR>
Note that, after running the cmake command, one of the files that is generated is called the CMakeCache.txt. To flush the cached variables, this file needs to be removed.
